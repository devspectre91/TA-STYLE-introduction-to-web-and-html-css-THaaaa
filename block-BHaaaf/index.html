      Logan, commonly known as the wolverine is the most fierce mutant from
      X-men series. He has retractable claws and an amazing quality to heal
      himself which gives him superiority over other mutants. At one point in
      his life, he participated in an experiment by William Stryker which
      involved putting admantium in his skeleton. He successfully recovered from
      that experiment. Now with admantum in his skeleton he was indestructible.
